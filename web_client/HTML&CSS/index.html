        <li>Create an external css file (file name: table.css) and link it in the table.html</li>
        <li>The table header elements have to be left aligned</li>
        <li>The td elements have to be center aligned</li>
        <li>When a mouse pointer is over a row, it has to change color including the table header row (green, ...)</li>
